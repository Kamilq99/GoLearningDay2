### Error Handling

1. **Basic Error Checking**: Write a function that opens a file with a given name and returns its contents as a string. Implement error handling to check whether the file exists, whether it was opened successfully, and handle errors appropriately.

2. **Function with Errors**: Write a function that divides two integers and returns the result and any error. Make sure to handle division by zero and return an appropriate error.

3. **Error in Structure**: Define your own error type by implementing the error interface. Then, use that error type in a function that simulates a database connection problem.

4. **Errors and Defer**: Write a function that uses defer to close the file after it has been opened. Make sure that errors related to opening the file are handled and passed on appropriately.

5. **Error chaining**: Write a function that calls another function that can return an error and checks if the error returned by that function is an os.ErrNotExist error. If so, display an appropriate message.

6. **Errors and panic**: Implement a function that can generate a panic if a specified number of attempts is exceeded. Use recover in the calling function to handle the panic and return an appropriate error.

7. **Error wrapping**: Write a function that returns an error with additional information (wraps an error) using the fmt and errors packages. Implement a function that uses errors.Is to check if the error is of the same type.

8. **Returning multiple errors**: Write a function that can return more than one error and handle them in the calling code.

9. **Network communication errors**: Implement a simple function that makes an HTTP request and handles any errors related to the connection or response.

10. **Errors in math operations**: Implement a function that accepts floating-point numbers and returns an error if one of the numbers is negative and the operation is not possible.
